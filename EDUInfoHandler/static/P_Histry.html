        the school is located in the Padavi Sripura Divisional Secretariat Division and Sewajanapada GS Division. <br>

        <br>

After that, in 1980, Advanced Level Arts Class and Commerce Class in 1982, started. Nearly 100 number of students  have been admitted to the university even in military  back ground.</P>
            <br>
