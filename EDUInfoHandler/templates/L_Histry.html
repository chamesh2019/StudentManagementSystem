        the school is located in the Padavi Sripura Divisional Secretariat Division and Sewajanapada GS Division. <br>

        <br>  
        
        <P>This is the first college established in Padavi Sri Pura  division and initially started offering classes up to 8th grade. <br>
            In 1964, ten children appeared for the general examination and for the first time, four children passed in 1968. After that, in 1980, Advanced Level Arts Class and Commerce Class in 1982, started. Nearly 100 number of students  have been admitted to the university even in military  back ground.</P>
            <br>
